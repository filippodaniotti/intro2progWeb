# Wrap up exercise
Build a web page showing a list of item, and the detail of one of them.

By clicking on an item in the list, the detail part will show its data (which have to be fetch and replaced via Ajax, retrieving them from a database).

The last 5 viewed items are listed in the bottom of the page. This list is obviously personalized for each user.

Access to the page is allowed only to authenticated users â€“ authentication has to be checked via a filter, which in case of failure redirects to a login page.
